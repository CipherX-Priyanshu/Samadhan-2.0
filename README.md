# Samadhan-2.0  
Hackathon's Tiny Task and Projects  

## JavaScript Learning Progress 🚀  
This repository contains my daily progress while learning **JavaScript (Phase 1)**.  
Each day has a separate folder with a `dayX.js` file that covers the concepts learned on that day.  
The file **progress.md** documents the overall journey and progress.
